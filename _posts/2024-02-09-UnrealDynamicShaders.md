During the last year of bachelor's degree in Game Programming at the SAE-Institute, the students of the Games Programming section had to create a game in collaboration with the Game Art and Audio Engineering sections. The purpose of the module was to simulate what was, for some, a first work experience in a professional-like environment.

## Contextualisation

For this project I had the opportunity to work as a Graphic Programmer on two game projects made in the Unreal Engine 5.3.

Project Girl & Kitty  | Project VR
:-----:|:-----:

For both project we had a limited production time, roughly 8 months, with a team of 27 people.

The tasks I worked on were the following:
- Creation of [shaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) and functions to replicate a watercolour style
- Graphic tools for the artists
- Asset integration, colorization, test and review
- Creation of Landscape shaders, [Virtual Texturing](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/VirtualTexturing/)
- Creation of a stylized water shader
- Creation of specific objects shaders and code (Plant Growth, Glowing Outline, Vertex deformation)

The VR project, being [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) based, didn't require specific shaders. For that reason, the focus will be emphasized on the research, iterations and global work done for the Girl & Kitty project.

The first elements to acknowledge is the art direction. One of the references given for the art style was "Dordogne"

The only problem was that compared to Dordogne, a game made with hand-painted textures by "[Un je ne sais quoi](https://unjenesaisquoi.fr/)" a professional french studio, we didn't have as much time and would risk having incoherent texturing from the artists. For that reason a major part of the texturing was done with shaders.

## Shaders

In this blogpost, I am going to detail the steps of the major task I have been doing during these projects as a graphic programmer.

In this section the following shaders will be exposed and detailed: 
- [Outline function](#outline-function)
- [Distortion function](#distortion-function)
- [Object fading](#object-fading)

Multiple iterations were done before being validated by the "Art Director", the head of the Game Art section.

### Outline function

The necessity to have a dynamic outline, that reacted to the players position and rotation when he crossed interactable objects, brought me to create this "Coloured_Outline" Material Function. Using the `Fresnel`, `Time` & `Sine` Nodes I created an "Emissive" effect.

The first thing to acknowledge is that in Unreal Engine, you can not modify in run-time static materials. For that reason I had to code an "Interactable" component and so that every object that had it would override its materials and create a dynamic material for it.
The `Begin Play()` method that initializes objects was the following:

Interactable.cpp:
```c++
void UInteractable::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	TArray<UStaticMeshComponent*> Meshes;
	GetOwner()->GetComponents<UStaticMeshComponent>(Meshes, true);
	for (int32 i = 0; i < Meshes.Num(); i++)
	{
		UStaticMeshComponent* StaticMeshComponent = Meshes[i];
		UMaterialInterface* Material = StaticMeshComponent->GetMaterial(0);
		UMaterialInstanceDynamic* DynMaterial = UMaterialInstanceDynamic::Create(Material, GetOuter());
		//UMaterialInstanceDynamic* DynMaterial = UMaterialInstanceDynamic::Create(Material, Meshes);
		DynMaterials.Add(DynMaterial);
		StaticMeshComponent->SetMaterial(0, DynMaterial);
	}

	//...
}
```
Note that there is `TArray<UMaterialInstanceDynamic*> DynMaterials;` located in the private variables of the `.h` file.

The `Enable_Outline` parameter (float) is used in the C++ code to activate it or not. I first went with a `Static bool` parameter but after research, since it is static, you can not modify it in code thus rendering it's activation impossible. Here is the code related to the "Interactable" objects:

Interactable.h
```c++
UPROPERTY(EditAnyWhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Visuals|Outline", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true", ClampMin = "0.0", ClampMax = "1.0", UIMin = "0.0", UIMax = "1.0"))
float MaxOutlineThickness = 0.3f;
UPROPERTY(EditAnyWhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Visuals|Outline", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))
float OutlineThickness = 0.0f;	
UPROPERTY(EditAnyWhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Visuals|Outline", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))
float CurrentOutlineValue = 0.0f;
//This float is used instead of a bool siince materials only have static bools
float OutlineEnabled = 0.0f;
```

Interactable.cpp
```c++
void UInteractable::TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ELevelTick TickType, FActorComponentTickFunction* ThisTickFunction)
{
	Super::TickComponent(DeltaTime, TickType, ThisTickFunction);
	
	if (EnableOutline)
	{

		OutlineThickness >= MaxOutlineThickness ? OutlineThickness = MaxOutlineThickness : OutlineThickness += DeltaTime;
		OutlineEnabled = 1.0f;
	}
	else
	{
		OutlineThickness <= 0.0f ? OutlineThickness = 0.0f : OutlineThickness -= DeltaTime;
		OutlineEnabled = 0.0f;
	}
	if (CurrentOutlineValue != OutlineThickness)
	{
		CurrentOutlineValue = OutlineThickness;
		SetOutline(OutlineThickness);
	}
```

The MF_Outline is the base function used to create the outline of objects. It simply colors every part of an object that has a normal vector direction according to the camera's position with a value superior to the `Outline_Thickness`.

I also linked an [Unreal Material Parameters Collection](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Materials/ParameterCollections/) to it. The idea was to give the artist the possibility to change its color in a simple "Color palette" for that purpose

### Distortion function
The distortion function was a simple function that just took the `Time`, `Panner` and `VertexNormalWS` nodes with a Normal map in a `TextureParameter2D` node to deform the object .

The only specificity was to multiply the `R` and `G` channels by the `Distortion_Power`, that was controlled in the C++ code, so that the effect could be enabled or not.

To use it I just had to branch it to world position offset in the object's material node.

### Object fading

## Final result

After multiple trials and exchanges with colleges and teachers, the results were the following:
